# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor] <br>
(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). <br>
Frontend Mentor helps me by actually being hands on with code instead of the cycle of watching tutorials without progress.

## Overview

  In this project we are tasked with creating a mock QR Code Component, the goal is to get this as similar to the provided solution.
  While doing this project I am planning to focus on responsiveness, I want the QR Code Component to look good on all devices.
  I hope to achieve this through flexbox and trial and error, I have never used media queries and things like that
  so incorporating them into this project while be beneficial.

## My process

    My process will go as follows:

     1. Organize the CSS file.
     
     2. Create the container div that will house the blue box with QR.
     
     3. Im not sure about this one yet, but create a second div to 
     house the bottom text.
     
     4. Add the bottom text and ensure it's centered in the containing div
     
     5. Add the final text and ensure it looks close to the solution.
