# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor]
(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). 
Frontend Mentor helps me by actually being hands on with code instead of the cycle of watching tutorials without progress.

## Overview

  In this project we are tasked with creating a mock QR Code Component, the goal is to get this as similar to the provided solution.
  While doing this project I am planning to focus on responsiveness, I want the QR Code Component to look good on all devices.
  I hope to achieve this through flexbox and trial and error, I have never used media querires and things like that
  incorporating them into this project while be beneficial.

## My process

    My process will go as follows:

    1. Find a good tutorial on Youtube that explains flexbox and how to apply them.
    2. I will start with developing my page for websites and scale up.
